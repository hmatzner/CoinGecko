# CoinGecko
Web scraping project to get information of the different cryptocurrencies

CoinGecko.com is a website containing information of thousands of different cryptocurrencies.
For 1st milestone we've selected the top 100 coins and scraped the website to get their current price, market cap and URL.
The script should run on every python IDLE, see requirements.txt for further information.

There are two versions of the file, .py and .ipynb, with a slight difference made in the second one to see the dataframe in a more aesthetic way.
